***************************************************

This is an implementation of the Joye-Libert
cryptosystem. Please note that this implementation
is based on the journal-version with some minor
corrections from the original paper.

A description of the cryptosystem is found in the
article: "Efficient Cryptosystems From $2^k$-th
 Power Residue Symbols", found here:
https://ia.cr/2013/435.

To compile the program, the GNU Multiple Integer
Precision library (GMPlib) must be installed.

With g++, a sample program can be compiled with:
g++ main.cpp joye_libert.cpp -o main -lgmp
